<p>Note: The data in this file are based on the 2012 Economic Census, Survey of Business Owners (SBO). To maintain confidentiality, the Census Bureau suppresses data to protect the identity of any business or individual. The census results in this file contain sampling and nonsampling errors. Data users who create their own estimates using data from this file should cite the Census Bureau as the source of the original data only.

<p><b>Release Date:</b> 2015-12-15</p>

<p>[NOTE: Includes firms with paid employees and firms with no paid employees. Data are based on the 2012 Economic Census, and the estimates of business ownership by gender, ethnicity, race, and veteran status are from the 2012 Survey of Business Owners. Detail may not add to total due to rounding or because a Hispanic firm may be of any race. Moreover, each owner had the option of selecting more than one race and therefore is included in each race selected. Firms with more than one domestic establishment are counted in each geographic area and industry in which they operate, but only once in the U.S. and state totals for all sectors.
